# üìù Guidelines for Writing React.js Documentation

## üìò Introduction Section

Begin each document with a clear and comprehensive introduction to the React.js topic at hand.  
If the focus is on **React Hooks**, ensure the introduction includes:

- A detailed explanation of what Hooks are  
- Their purpose and benefits  
- Key foundational concepts such as Functional Components, State, and Side Effects  

This sets the stage for deeper understanding and smooth progression.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Code Description Standards

When adding or updating code examples:

- Include a **brief summary** directly below the section heading  
- Follow with a **detailed explanation** immediately after the code block  
- Keep all prose to a maximum of **80 characters per line**, ending each line with  
  **two spaces** for clean formatting  
- If a code block lacks a description, add one using this structure  

Consistency in formatting ensures readability across all documentation.

## Example Structure and Style

Examples should build progressively‚Äîfrom basic concepts to advanced implementations.  
Avoid numbering section titles (e.g., "Example 1: Basic State"). Instead, use descriptive titles like:  
**Basic State with `useState`**

Follow these conventions:

- Use **React 19.2** features
- Use local JSON data for simulating data or simple Express app when neeeded in more complex
  examples when needed.
- Generate and manage projects using **Bun.js**  
- Apply **modern React patterns**: Functional Components, Hooks, ES6+ syntax  
- Adhere to **React best practices**: proper dependency arrays, clear component naming, modular structure  
- Replace overused greetings like **"Hello World!"** with neutral alternatives such as **"Hello there!"**  
- Maintain alignment with existing documentation standards and repository structure
